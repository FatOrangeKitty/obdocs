# Passive Implings \(WIP\)

Passive implings are the implings your minion can catch whilst doing activities, outside of puro-puro. It doesn't require any input from the user, your minion will automatically catch them if you have the required Hunter level.

Visit the OSRS wiki for a reference of each Impling: [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Impling](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Impling)

You can only get Crystal implings in the following activities: Gauntlet, Zalcano, Killing Dark beasts or Priff elves, or pickpocketing priff elves.
