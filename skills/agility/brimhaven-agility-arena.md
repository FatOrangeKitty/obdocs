# Brimhaven Agility Arena

An alternative form of agility training is to use the `+agilityarena`. While your minion will take some time to learn the ins and outs of the agility arena, this minigame can be quite rewarding, providing agility arena tickets which can be turned in for additional agility xp, a graceful recolour, herbs, and even a Pirate's hook! If you have the stats for the Karamja Medium diary, your xp from obstacles and from turning in tickets will be increased by 10%. If you have the stats for the Karamja Elite diary, you will get 10% more tickets from the minigame.

You can spend your tickets on the items below using the `+aa buy` item command.
