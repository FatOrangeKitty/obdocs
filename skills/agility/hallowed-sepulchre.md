# Hallowed Sepulchre

You can now challenge the Hallowed Sepulchre and unlock the Dark Graceful outfit, the Dark Squirrel recolor, and the Ring of Endurance, as well as the other unique and useful items provided by this minigame! You can get started by using the `+sepulchre` command, with a base agility level of 52 being required. The rewards increase the higher level floor you can reach, as will the number of hallowed marks you will obtain.

With all available boosts, it is possible to get 91473 xp/hr while doing floor 5.
