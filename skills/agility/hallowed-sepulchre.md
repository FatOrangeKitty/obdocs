# Hallowed Sepulchre

You can now challenge the Hallowed Sepulchre and unlock the Dark Graceful outfit, the Dark Squirrel recolor, and the Ring of Endurance, as well as the other unique and useful items provided by this minigame! You can get started by using the `+sepulchre` command, with a base agility level of 52 being required. The rewards increase the higher level floor you can reach, as will the number of hallowed marks you will obtain.

Items from the sepulchre shop can speed up your performance, as well as the Strange Old Lockpick and the Ring of Endurance, both of which are obtainable from the sepulchre itself and provide respective boosts of 1% and 4%.

With all available boosts, it is possible to get 91473 xp/hr while doing floor 5.

| **Floor** | **Agility level required** |
| :--- | :---: |
| 1 | 52 |
| 2 | 62 |
| 3 | 72 |
| 4 | 82 |
| 5 | 92 |

## **Hallowed Sepulchre Shop**

The following items can be purchased using the `+buy` command using hallowed marks. Many of these items provide a boost to your performance in the sepulchre.

| **Item** | **Hallowed marks required** | **Boost provided** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Hallowed crystal shard | 1 | N/A |
| Hallowed token | 10 | N/A |
| Hallowed grapple | 100 | 3% |
| Hallowed focus | 100 | 3% |
| Hallowed symbol | 100 | 3% |
| Hallowed hammer | 100 | 3% |
| Hallowed ring | 250 | N/A |
| Dark dye | 300 | N/A |
| Dark acorn | 3,000 | N/A |

The dark graceful set can be made using the `+buy dark graceful` piece command with the base graceful item and a dark dye in your bank. If you have obtained a Giant Squirrel agility pet, you can `+buy dark squirrel` if you have the pet and the dark acorn in your bank to transmogrify the pet.

#### Strange Old Lockpick

The strange old lockpick provides boosts to several places in the bot; namely Barrows and Hallowed Sepulchre, as it has a purpose in those locations in game. However, unlike its in game counterpart, the strange old lockpick is **untradeable** in the bot, and has **infinite charges**. Because of this, its drop rate is significantly lower than in game, increasing its rarity.

| Floor | Drop Rate |
| :--- | :--- |
| Floor 1 | 1/2,000 |
| Floor 2 | 1/1,500 |
| Floor 3 | 1/1,100 |
| Floor 4 | 1/800 |
| Floor 5 | 1/600 |

These rates are calculated **by chest**, not by floor. The number of chests on each floor can be found [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Coffin_%28Hallowed_Sepulchre%29#Locations), on the OSRS wiki.  
This means that while doing the Hallowed Sepulchre at 92+ agility, you will have an approximately 1/150 chance of receiving a strange old lockpick each lap.
