# Passive Implings

As your minion is on a trip, it will catch any implings it sees, provided it has the hunter level.

A list of each impling, as well as their level requirements, can be found [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Impling#Implings).

Crystal implings are only available when doing activities within Prifddinas. This includes the Gauntlet, Zalcano, Killing Dark Beasts, or pickpocketing Prifddinas Elves.

You can view the collection log for implings by doing `+cl implings`.
