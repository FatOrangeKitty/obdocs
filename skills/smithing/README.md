# Smithing

You can train Smithing using `+smith` & `+smelt` `+smelt [quantity] <bar>`, for example `+smelt 50 bronze bar` `+smith [quantity] <item>`, for example `+smith adamant dart tips`

An Alternative way to train smithing is now through use of the blast furnace in order to do this you can use `+bf barname` or `+blastfurnace barname`.  At the blast furnace you can expect higher xp/hr and by proxy expect to make more bars/hr.  In order to use the blast furnace you will be required to meet the following.

* Crafting: 12
* Firemaking: 16
* Magic: 33
* Mining: 50
* Smithing: 20
* Thieving: 13

Smithing is one of the more useful skills on the bot, because it is required to create Godswords and such!

You can receive a boost to gold bar smelting xp rates by equipping the goldsmith gauntlets which increases the xp/bar from 22.5 to 56.2.
